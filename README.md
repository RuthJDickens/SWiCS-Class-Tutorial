# SWiCS-Class-Tutorial

Tutorial resources were provided by Sumo Digital in conjunction with Sheffield Women in Computer Science. This Space Invaders type lasers and saucers game does use Playbuffer as a basis but relies less on the premade functions to faciliate moving away from the GameObject struct and onto my a GameObject class.

I began by making Laser and Saucer classes and then moved on to incorporating hierachy by implementing the GameObject class provided.

To further extend the game I created a player class and a second enemy type; the Red Saucer.
